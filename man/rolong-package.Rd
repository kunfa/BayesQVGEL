\title{Bayesian Quantile Variable Selection with Mixed Effects Model in Longitudinal Study}
\description{
In longitudinal studies, the same subjects are measured repeatedly over time, leading to correlations among the repeated measurements. Properly accounting for the inner cluster correlations in the presence of data heterogeneity and long tailed distributions of the disease phenotype is challenging, especially in the context of high dimensional regressions. Here, we aim at developing novel Bayesian regularized quantile mixed effect models to tackle these challenges.In this package, we have implemented the Gibbs samplers of Bayesian quantile variable selection method in the mixed effects model with the spike-and-slab priors. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms of the proposed and alternative models can be efficiently performed by using the package.

\details{
The user friendly, integrated interface \strong{rolong()} allows users to flexibly choose the fitting methods by specifying the following parameter:
\tabular{rl}{
slope: \tab whether to use random intercept and slope model.\cr\cr
robust: \tab whether to use robust methods for modelling.\cr\cr
quant: \tab to specify different quantiles when using robust methods.\cr\cr
sparse: \tab whether to use the spike-and-slab priors to impose sparsity.
}

The function rolong() returns a rolong object that contains the posterior estimates of each coefficients.
